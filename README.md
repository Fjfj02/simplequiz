# Simple Quiz

## Purpose

Simple Quiz is an app to test your general knowledge through true/false questions. It was based on a course I took.

Initially, it was just a direct quiz on the terminal with a limited database. However, recently, an interface and a variable database with API were added.

## Overview

Its operation is very simple, as you can see, according to the image, there are questions where you just press a true/false button. And just like that, your score is marked.

The interface may be crooked if it is not running on Windows.

## Run code

First you have to install the following library:

```shell
pip install requests
```

To run the code, use:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Change of data

If you want to change the style or number of questions, change the data.py file. (API)
